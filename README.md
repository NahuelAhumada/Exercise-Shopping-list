Notes: I know there are better ways to do this exercise like using containers for each ul element or putting the buttons inside the li's tags and then use parentChild and remove().
Instead, i wanted to show you a different way to do so, using some methods that i found. Keep in mind that i didn't change the html file, it would have been easier that way.
